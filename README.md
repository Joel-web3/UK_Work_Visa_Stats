## Introduction
Driven by a personal quest to understand the dynamics of the UK's work visa system, particularly in the wake of an intriguing encounter with TikTok videos on the skilled worker visa, I embarked on a detailed analysis of the UK work visa landscape for 2023. This study, leveraging data from www.gov.uk focuses on the first three quarters of the year, offering a contemporary view of the UK's immigration trends post-Brexit. Below are some key findings and insights.

## 1. Asian Dominance in Work Visa Grants
One of my SQL queries revealed <ins>a total of 79,003 work visas granted to people from Asia South</ins>. Some of the countries in this region include India and Pakistan.

Now I’ve always heard that there are a lot of Nigerians in the UK but recently, I’ve had my friend tell me how he’s been seeing so many Asians compared to Nigerians. So I wasn’t quite surprised by the output of this query but then I asked what could be the reason behind this and below are some probable answers I could think of.

- **Post-Brexit Immigration System:** Since Brexit, there has been a shift in the UK's immigration system, which has resulted in more non-EU nationals working in the UK. This change isn't solely due to work visas but also other categories of immigration, indicating a broader trend of the UK's labour market opening up to global talent beyond the European Union​.

- **High Numbers from Specific Countries:** The data for work visa grants by nationality showed that a significant number of work visas were granted to individuals from countries like India, which alone accounted for <ins>over 53,000 work visas</ins>.

This indicates that there is a strong demand for workers from certain Asian countries, which could be due to a combination of factors including the UK's historical connections, specific skill sets of workers, or labour market needs.

## 2. Nigeria's Prominence
Earlier on, I made mention of how I’d always heard that there are a lot of Nigerians in the UK. Well, that is, in fact, true because an SQL query for the total work visa grants by nationality, <ins>revealed Nigeria in second place with a total of 23,646 work visa grants</ins>.

The prominence of Nigerians in the list of UK work visas granted could be due to a multitude of factors, and while the talent of individuals from Nigeria certainly plays a role, it's important to consider a holistic picture:

- **Skill Levels and Education:** Nigerians are known to have high levels of education and professional skills in various sectors. This could make them attractive candidates for the UK's labour market, especially in industries where there is a shortage of skilled workers locally.

- **Demand in Specific Sectors:** With the UK having a high demand in sectors where Nigerians have established expertise, such as tech, healthcare, or finance, there’s bound to be a higher number of visas being granted to Nigerian nationals.

- **English Language Proficiency:** As English is an official language in Nigeria, this removes the language barrier, which is a significant advantage when applying for work in the UK.

## 3. Visa Grants By Occupation
Occupations paint the most vivid picture of the UK's labour market needs and the global response to it. Care workers and nurses top the list, signalling the UK's need to support its healthcare system, perhaps exacerbated by an ageing population and the aftermath of health crises.

The substantial number of grants for IT professionals reflects the UK's ambition to remain at the forefront of the digital economy. The array of occupations further down the list, from chefs to accountants, highlights the diverse economic fabric the UK is nurturing through its immigration policy.

## 4. Visa Grants By Subgroup
The visa subgroup data from 2023 shows a distinctive prioritization of skills and sectors within the UK's immigration framework. The 'Skilled Worker - Health & Care' subgroup leading the chart by a wide margin is a clear testament to the ongoing investment in public health, perhaps a strategic response to ensuring a resilient healthcare system post-pandemic.

The 'Skilled Worker' category following next aligns with the broader economic agenda to attract talent essential for various sectors of the economy. The lower numbers for 'Intra-company Transfers' might suggest a trend towards local hiring or a shift in corporate strategies due to evolving global business environments.

This comprehensive analysis not only sheds light on the current state of the UK's work visa dynamics but also offers a glimpse into the evolving patterns of global migration and the UK's strategic response to its labour market needs in a post-Brexit world.
